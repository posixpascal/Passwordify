# Passwordify

An "in-development" webapp to test various passwords. This project was created 4 years ago and I really hate the source code.
I'll rewrite the whole app in my spare time using Angular.js or Backbone.

While I'm here I opened a GitHub Page for this website located here: [http://posixpascal.github.io/Passwordify/](github.io/posixpascal/Passwordify)
